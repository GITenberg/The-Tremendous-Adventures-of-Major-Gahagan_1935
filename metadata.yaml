description: As soon as I entered the tents a host of menials sprang forward, some
  to ease me of my armour, some to offer me refreshments, some with hookahs, attar
  of roses (in great quart bottles), and the thousand delicacies of Eastern life.
  I motioned them away. ""I will wear my armour,"" said I; ""I shall go forth to-night.
  Carry my duty to the princess, and say I grieve that to-night I have not the time
  to see her.
